    <p> Hey there! I live and work here in Chapel Hill in the heart of North Carolina. After moving to North Carolina from Peteluma California when I was young I have lived here ever since and have been blessed with wonderful friends and family in the area. I spent my late teens in Boone, NC and after atending classes at the local community college I returned to the Chapel Hill area to finish an Associates in Science at Alamance Community College, where I focused on chemistry and mathmatics. During the finishing months of my humble degree I was hired on by Holmes Oil Company, where I served for several years as a marketing analyst and pricebbok coordinator. Realizing the convienience store industry was not a good fit for me I decided to persue a [suprisingly] more lucrative career in the food service industry. I went on to work as an independent contractor for Takeout Central, a local third party food delivery service. I am currently attending UNC's Coding Bootcamp in the hopes of pursuing a new career in web development and look forward to the chalenges ahead.
